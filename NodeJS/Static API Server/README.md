# Static API Server

This is a development pure NodeJS server that returns static json files from a route.

## Current characteristics

- Method independent (Allows you to make GET, POST,... or any method and fake the server answer)
- Params independent

## Usage

Simply execute the command `node serve.js` and it will run in `localhost:3000` using the URL path as the relative path from the server execution path.

To test run in this folder and go to `http://localhost:3000/hello `.
